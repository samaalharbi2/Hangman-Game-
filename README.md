# Hangman Game in Python

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Hangman game using Python. The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list, and the player will need to guess the word by proposing individual letters. We'll keep track of the number of lives remaining and display ASCII art based on how many lives the player has left. The game ends when the word is fully guessed or when the player runs out of lives
